1) Let's say we told you your app needs to search yet another repository, together with Github. What considerations will you make when update your app?
2) How would your app deal with the Github API going down?
3) Did you consider creating a separate branch on your project? What did you do on the other branch?
4) Is your app responsive?
5) Why should I use your app, instead of something that's already out there?
